# Rebuilding Enumerable Methods in Ruby

> In this project, I have rebuilt my own version of enumerable methods in Ruby

## Getting started

In order to test rebuilt methods:
1. You need to have ruby environment installed.. [Instruction] (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Create a file with tests (calling function on different arrays). Do not forget to include enumerable.rb file and feel free to check methods with different test cases of your choice
